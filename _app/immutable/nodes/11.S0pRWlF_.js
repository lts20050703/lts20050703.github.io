				narrating the story. In the case of "The many deaths of Laila Starr", having a third person
				narrator allowed the author to tell a parallel story of Laila Starr and Darius Shah.
				However, after reading some of my classmates' discussion posts, one thing that keeps being
				mentioned is that the story can be confusing at times, due to the frequent jumping back and
				forth in time, as well as jumping between Darius and Laila's point of view. Since I have
				some experience with making websites in the past and often use social media, my thought was
				“What if I transform the story from a third person view to focus on Darius, and you are
				friends with him on Facebook?”.</div> <div>After the initial idea, I started writing, putting myself into Darius's shoes, like what
				would he post to his Facebook when something important happens. After having a rough number
				of posts, I start making the website, putting all the posts into it.</div> <div>If you use Facebook or any social media, you might notice that the timeline is sorted in
				reverse, with oldest posts at the top instead of at the bottom, and this is intentional. In
				Facebook's case, it makes sense to put the latest post at the top for easy viewing, but
				because this is a story I'm trying to tell, it makes more sense to order the posts
				chronologically.</div></div> <h3 class="text-center">Works Cited</h3> <div>V, Ram, et al. The Many Deaths of Laila Starr. Boom!
