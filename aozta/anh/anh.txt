# Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions.
A look inside the world of computer hacking can be a fascinating experience. And in this hackers' paradise, computer software is constantly being attacked - sometimes for ethical reasons, but all too often not. And the goal of such attacks is to corrupt the target computer without its owner's knowledge, and get it to do something which the owner did not intend it to do.
For those who perpetrate these attacks and try to force their entry into secure and unsecured websites - in other words, the so-called 'hackers' - hacking is both an art and a science; art, because it can be as original and, dare I say, beautiful as a landscape painting; science, because of its technical features. But as beautiful and intelligent as the process can be, the problem is that many hackers paint with an unethical brush; these unscrupulous sorts are up to no good. They might want to steal personal information, alter a corporation's financial figures, break security codes to gain unapproved network access, or carry out other damaging activities.
There are two types of people who turn to computer hacking: those who are drawn to hacking out of intellectual inquisitiveness and those with darker motives for their interest. But the features that all hackers share are their technological savviness, their eagerness to take risks and their considerable knowledge of programming languages.
Computer hacking always involves some degree of violation of the confidentiality of others; breaking through network security and damaging or compromising personal files, web pages or software. It may also involve downloading or modifying such files without permission, and the consequences can vary from slight alarm at having been targeted - prompting an overdue security upgrade - to total despair at the realization that your entire database of private-client information has been lifted from your intranet.
However, many big-shot companies now employ teams of professional hackers tasked with identifying system weaknesses before the 'bad guys' do. Such staff use their own hacking skills to basically simulate what a real hacker might get up to. Where they succeed in beating the system, extra security measures are then put in place. This so-called ethical hacking helps to stop identity theft and other such cyber crimes.
Hackers like this who try to breach security for the right reasons are commonly termed 'white-hat hackers'. The ones with malicious intent are referred to as 'black-hat hackers'. These are the guys who infect our computers with viruses, run credit-card scams, are involved in identity theft, or are simply what is termed 'cyber vandals' - hackers who cause harm just for the sake of it because they enjoy causing problems.
But black-hat hackers beware; the good guys are coming to get you!
Question 31: Why is computer hacking considered "art"?
*A.Because it involves creativity.
B. Because it has certain technical aspects.
C. Because it involves painting beautiful landscapes.
D. Because it is as daring as painting.
Question 32: What do people who hack unethically NOT do?
*A.gain authorized access to networks
B. modify financial data
C. breach security codes
D. steal personal data
Question 33: What is NOT a characteristic of hackers?
*A.excellent modern language skills
B. intellectual curiosity
C. attraction to risk
D. a practical understanding of technology
Question 34: Why do big-shot companies hire teams of hackers?
*A.to identify systems vulnerable to attack
B. to damage competitors' software and files
C. to 'hack' the hackers themselves
D. to find unethical hackers
Question 35: What is true about black-hat hackers?
*A.Some of them cause computer problems just for fun.
B. They are involved in efforts to stop identity theft.
C. They misuse their company credit cards.
D. They look for weaknesses in company systems to repair them.
# Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions.
PARKS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
The practice of wilderness preservation had hardly begun internationally when, in 1887, New Zealand declared the peaks of its sacred volcanoes Tongariro and Ruapehu a national park. It was then only the fourth national park on the globe, the other three having been established in the U.S., Australia and Canada in the two preceding decades. So where did the idea originate? Despite American author Wallace Stegner's famous comment that "National parks are the best idea we ever had. Absolutely American, absolutely democratic," made in 1983, the English poet William Wordsworth had described the British Lake District as a "sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy" as early as 1835.
In this spirit, the earliest legislation that governed national parks in New Zealand originally determined that they be created primarily for the visual splendor of their scenery rather than for their ecological significance, and there was a tendency to include majestic but unproductive highlands which were of little agricultural or other economic significance, rather than more <b><u>accessible</u></b> and potentially cultivatable land.
This historical oversight was unfortunate for New Zealand, a country which has some of the most unique flora and fauna in the world. The plants and animals of New Zealand evolved in complete isolation from other land for close to eighty million years, survivors of the ancient Gondwanaland which once included most of the landmasses in today's Southern Hemisphere. The international importance of this flora and fauna has long been acknowledged by the scientific community, and in 1980 alterations were made to national laws allowing areas of prime ecological worth, often under threat from industries such as logging or mining, to be considered for inclusion in the park network. Thus, ecologically rich lowland forests which had previously been <b><u>overlooked</u></b> could now be preserved. In 1990 a massive area of 2.6 million hectares in the country's South Island was named a World Heritage Area; it includes four separate national parks including both of the country's highest peaks as well fjord lands and water.
New Zealanders have also chosen to protect rare habitats in a variety of other reserves. These include off-shore islands that aim to provide havens for many of the world's most critically endangered species, among them large flightless birds whose evolution and existence in a land without predatory mammals was threatened by the arrival of humans and the introduction of non-native animal species. Marine reserves too have gradually been established. Perhaps one of the most remarkable salutes to New Zealand's unique geographical status came in 2012, when the world's newest dark sky reserve was announced. Covering 4300sq km of New Zealand's South Island, the Aoraki Mackenzie world's largest "Dark Park." Open 24 hours a day, it was the first to be awarded gold level status, recognizing the quality of the almost lightpollution-free skies which make it a prime star-gazing location for amateur and professional astronomers alike. So the traveler's day of wonder in the New Zealand landscape need not end at sundown. Lying back beneath the southern night skies, we can continue to marvel at the beauties offered us by our fragile and magical planet.
