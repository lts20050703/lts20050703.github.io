Getting up with the Jacksons
The alarm clock in Mr. and Mrs. Jackson {went off} at 6:30 AM. Sleepily, Mr. Jackson reached toward it to {turn} it {off}. He {gave up} trying to reach it and let it {run down}. Mrs. Jackson was awake. She {turned on} the light beside the bed and shook her husband. It's time to {get up}, George," she told him. "Aw-don't" he muttered. But she {kept on} shaking him until he was awake. He {sat up}, but he kept his eyes closed. Finally, he {stood up}. Mr. Jackson put on a bathrobe. He {went in} to take a shower and went downstairs to help Mrs. Jackson set the table. In the kitchen, Mrs. Jackson {plugged in} the coffee maker. She also wanted to boil eggs, but remembered that they had {used up} the eggs the day before. She put bread into the toaster and waited for it to {pop up}. Mr. Jackson put cereal, milk and juice on the table. Then Mrs. Jackson {let out} the cat. She called the sixteen year-old twins. "Breakfast!" she shouted. "Jim! Jane!" In a few minutes four were at the table. "What on the world do you {have on}?" Jim asked Jane. "I forgot to {wash out} my clothes last night, so this morning I {hunted up} these things to wear." "I thought you had {given away} those old things," Jim told her. "They look shabby." "{get off} my back!" she said angrily. "Children," Mrs. Jackson begged, "please don't {get into} a fight. I'm {running out of} patience with both of you. I don't {feel like} listening to another argument. Tom didn't often argue before he left for college. Jane, you should {put} your clothes {away}. Then you should find something better to wear. I've told both of you again and again, to {hang up} your clothes." George Jackson was reading a newspaper. He laughed softly. If you {come across} something funny or even interesting, you might {let} us {in on} it," his wife said. "I'm just {looking at} the sports pages, Edna," he told her. "You usually don't {care for} professional sports." She went to {see about} the cat and {let} it {in}. The twins {picked up} their schoolbooks and went to school. George {put on} his coat. As he was {set out} for work, he said to his wife, "Have a good day, Edna."
