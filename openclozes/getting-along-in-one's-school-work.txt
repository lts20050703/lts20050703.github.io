Getting along in one's school work
Tom Jackson and Dave Page were {heading for} the library. Lee Choy and Pedro Garcia wanted to {catch up with} them. Are you {going after} a book? Lee asked Tom. "Yes," said Tom. "I need to {look for} another book about airplanes. I was {checking over} my paper, and I found out that I had {put in} some wrong information." "I must {look up} an article," David added. "My history teacher kept us {reading through} a long article for an hour. {keeping up with} that course is difficult for me. I'm always {falling behind}.
That's because I {put off} doing my assignments. "So do I," said Pedro. "My teacher asked me to write a science paper for the class. I {tore up} the first paper because it was bad. Now I have several new ideas, and I've been {trying} them {out on} my friend Maria. I have to {hand in} my paper on Monday. I also need to {brush up on} my mathematics, but I can't {figure out} the meaning of these signs." "I know what you mean," Dave told him. "I don't know what some of the signs {stand for} either." "This test needs {making up}," Tom said. "I missed it when I was sick, but I will wait until I have {turned in} my paper on airplanes. I keep a list of things I should do, and I {cross} them {off} one by one as I do them." "You are so systematic, Tom." Dave said, smiling. "You have been used to planning everything: I should {put together} a list, too, but it would be too long. I would just {give up}." "Sometimes I want to give up, too," said Tom, "but then I think that I'll {pull through} somehow. Studying so much is hard, but usually we {get along} rather well. We just have to {keep at it}." "Yes," Lee said "we do. But sometimes I'd like to {get away} from it all."
